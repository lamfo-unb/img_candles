Image Candles is a LAMFO project that used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification. An attempt was made to train the neural network in images such as the following:

This is a 'candlestick' graph that represents price variations of *American Airlines Group Inc* between 2008-12-05 and 2009-03-13. 
It is widely known that graphical analysis plays an important role in different types of markets, in a sense that some agents influence their decisions by signals solely given in the patterns found in this kinds of plots. The motivation for this project is that a CNN could possibly learn this graphical patterns that influence decisions, and predict price variations better than a human.
